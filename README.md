# What Is This Tool?
This tool allows you to convert json files, and csv files into kml files which is Google Earth Pro's file extension

# How Do I Use It?
1. Copy and paste the python code into your IDE (PyCharm, VSCode, etc) and run the script.
2. If you do not understand the parameters needed to be filled out check out the test directory [CSV](https://github.com/DougCodez/To-KML-Tool/tree/main/python%20files/csv%20to%20kml%20tool%20test) | [JSON](https://github.com/DougCodez/To-KML-Tool/tree/main/python%20files/json%20to%20kml%20tool%20test)
3. Type the directory of the file you're trying to get and then tyepe the file name (no need to include the extension). 
4. If all goes right the file will save on your directory of where you grabbed your csv / json file. 
5. Double click on that kml file where ever it is stored and it should take you to that location on the Google Earth Pro Desktop Application.
